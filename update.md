### Project Report: Custom Multi-Step Lead Submission Form for WordPress Plugin (Revised)

#### Overview:
This project aims to create a flexible, customizable multi-step lead submission form within a WordPress plugin. The form collects basic and detailed lead information in a two-step process, ensuring that:
1. **Lead data is captured even if the user doesn’t complete the second page**.
2. **The form is highly customizable** via an admin panel for text, colors, and field mappings.
3. **Lead data is submitted to MaidCentral and Zapier** based on admin preferences.
4. **The user experience encourages submission** of the first page, with the second page collecting optional, additional details.

#### Key Fields for Submission to MaidCentral:
Based on the provided MaidCentral Lead Form POST data, the form will capture the following fields:

- **First Page Fields**:
  - `FirstName`: User’s first name.
  - `LastName`: User’s last name.
  - `Email`: User’s email address.
  - `Phone`: User’s phone number.
  - `Zip`: User’s zip code.
  - `CustomerSourceId`: Identifies the lead source (set programmatically).
  - `RedirectUrl`: URL for redirection after successful submission.

- **Second Page Fields** (Optional for more detailed information):
  - `HomeAddress1`: Home address (line 1).
  - `HomeCity`: City of the home.
  - `HomeRegion`: State/Region of the home.
  - `ScopeGroupId`: ID indicating the group/type of service (e.g., Recurring Service, Deep Clean).
  - `ScopeOfWorkId`: Specific ID for the detailed work required.
  - `Frequency`: Frequency of service (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly).
  - `HomeBedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
  - `HomeFullBathrooms`: Number of full bathrooms.
  - `HomeSquareFeet`: Total square footage of the home.

The two-step form ensures that the essential first-page data is always captured, while the second page collects additional details for more accurate service estimates.

### Multi-Step Form Workflow:

##### 1. **First Page Submission**:
- **Encouraging Submission**: The first page requires only basic information (name, email, phone, ZIP code), making it simple and less overwhelming, thus encouraging users to submit the form.
- **Real-Time Submission**: First-page data is submitted via **AJAX** and stored in the **WordPress `wp_options` table** immediately, ensuring lead capture even if the second page is not completed.
  
##### 2. **Second Page Submission (Optional)**:
- **Comprehensive Data**: The second page collects additional information like address, service type, and number of rooms. This helps to better tailor service quotes.
- **Explanation to Users**: The second page will clearly inform users that the lead has already been submitted with basic information and that providing more details will help improve service accuracy.

### Updated Server-Side Handling (No WP-Cron):

To ensure that lead data is submitted reliably without depending on WP-Cron or website traffic, we have updated the approach to rely on **real-time AJAX submissions** and **server-side logic** for finalizing submissions.

#### **First Page Submission**:
When the user submits the first page, the data is immediately sent to the WordPress server using **AJAX**. The data is stored in `wp_options` with a unique lead ID and a timestamp, ensuring that the form data is captured and stored in real-time.

##### AJAX Code for First Page Submission:
```javascript
$('#firstPageForm').on('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = $(this).serialize();
    
    $.ajax({
        url: ajaxurl,
        type: 'POST',
        data: {
            action: 'submit_first_page',
            formData: formData
        },
        success: function(response) {
            console.log('First page submitted successfully');
            setTimeout(() => {
                finalizeSubmission(response.lead_id);
            }, 300000); // 5-minute timeout
        },
        error: function(error) {
            console.error('Error submitting first page');
        }
    });
});
```

##### Server-Side Handling for First Page Submission:
Once the first page data is received, it is stored as **JSON** in the `wp_options` table. This ensures the data is immediately available, even if the user abandons the second page.

```php
add_action('wp_ajax_submit_first_page', 'submit_first_page');
function submit_first_page() {
    $form_data = json_encode($_POST['formData']);
    $lead_id = uniqid();
    
    // Store first page data and timestamp in wp_options
    update_option('lead_submission_' . $lead_id, [
        'data' => $form_data,
        'timestamp' => time()
    ]);

    wp_send_json_success(['lead_id' => $lead_id]);
}
```

---

### Second Page Submission (Optional):

If the user completes the second page, the data is submitted and merged with the first-page data stored in the `wp_options` table. If the user does not complete the second page, the first-page data will be automatically finalized after 5 minutes using **server-side logic**.

##### Server-Side Handling for Second Page Submission:
```php
add_action('wp_ajax_submit_second_page', 'submit_second_page');
function submit_second_page() {
    $lead_id = $_POST['lead_id'];
    $lead_data = get_option('lead_submission_' . $lead_id);

    if ($lead_data) {
        // Merge second page data with existing data
        $existing_data = json_decode($lead_data['data'], true);
        $new_data = json_encode(array_merge($existing_data, $_POST['secondPageData']));

        // Update wp_options with the combined data
        update_option('lead_submission_' . $lead_id, [
            'data' => $new_data,
            'timestamp' => $lead_data['timestamp']
        ]);

        wp_send_json_success('Second page data saved');
    } else {
        wp_send_json_error('Lead not found');
    }
}
```

### Automatic Finalization Without WP-Cron:

If the second page is not completed within 5 minutes, the system will automatically submit the first-page data to **Zapier** and **MaidCentral**. This process happens via **server-side logic** and does not rely on user traffic or WP-Cron.

##### Server-Side Timeout Logic:
```php
function finalize_submission_if_needed($lead_id) {
    $lead_data = get_option('lead_submission_' . $lead_id);

    // Check if more than 5 minutes have passed since first submission
    if (isset($lead_data['timestamp']) && time() - $lead_data['timestamp'] > 300) {
        // Submit data to Zapier and MaidCentral
        send_to_third_party($lead_data['data']);
        
        // Remove lead data from wp_options after submission
        delete_option('lead_submission_' . $lead_id);
    }
}

function send_to_third_party($form_data) {
    // Example for sending data to Zapier
    $zapier_url = 'https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...';
    wp_remote_post($zapier_url, array(
        'body' => $form_data,
        'headers' => array('Content-Type' => 'application/json')
    ));

    // Example for sending data to MaidCentral
    $maidcentral_url = 'https://yourcompany.maidcentral.com/api/v1/leads';
    wp_remote_post($maidcentral_url, array(
        'body' => $form_data,
        'headers' => array('Content-Type' => 'application/json')
    ));
}
```

### Admin Customization Options:

The plugin will allow administrators to customize the form’s appearance, behavior, and field mappings via the admin panel.

#### 1. **Button Customization**:
- **Button Colors**: Admins can set the background color of the form’s submit buttons.
- **Button Text**: Admins can modify the button text (e.g., "Submit" to "Get Started").

#### 2. **Text and Heading Customization**:
- **Heading Text**: Customizable heading text for the form (e.g., "Get a Free Quote").
- **Heading Text Color**: Admins can change the heading text color to match the site's branding.

#### 3. **Form Field Customization**:
- **Field Labels**: Admins can modify the labels of form fields (e.g., "Enter Your Phone Number").
- **ScopeGroupId and ScopeOfWorkId**: Admins can assign or modify `ScopeGroupId` and `ScopeOfWorkId` via dropdowns in the admin panel to match their specific service types.

##### Example of Admin Panel Customizations:
- **Button Customization**: Admins can set the background color of the submit buttons and customize the text.
- **Heading Customization**: Admins can input custom heading text and set its color to match branding.
- **ScopeGroupId and ScopeOfWorkId** Dropdowns: Admins can assign specific values to these fields based on their business needs (e.g., recurring services, deep cleans).

### Summary:

- The multi-step form captures essential lead information on the first page, with the second page collecting optional additional details.
- The real-time submission of the first page ensures lead data is never lost, even if the user abandons the form before completing the second page.
- **Admin customization** allows for flexible control over the form's appearance, behavior, and field mappings.
- **Server-side logic** automatically finalizes submissions after 5 minutes, eliminating the need for WP-Cron, and ensuring the data is submitted to **MaidCentral

** and **Zapier** in real-time.
  
This revised approach ensures a robust and flexible solution for capturing leads, providing a better user experience while maintaining admin control and flexibility.
